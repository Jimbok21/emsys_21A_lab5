# EmSys Lab 5: ESP32 PWM and Verilog PWM 

In this lab you will write some code that will interact with some of the hardware peripherals. You will then describe those hardware peripherals in Verilog and simulate them. You must complete the following tasks for this lab:

* [Task 1] configure one of the hardware timer peripherals on the ESP32 device.
* [Task 2] construct the hardware and MMIO interface for one of the ESP32 hardware timers in Verilog.
* [Task 3] configure one of the PWM peripheral to generate a PWM signal on your ESP32 device.
* [Task 4] construct the hardware and MMIO interface for a PWM peripheral in Verilog.
